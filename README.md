# Machine_Learning

In Machine Learning, an algorithm uses the data from a system to give us insights and decision making abilities with 
respect to the system. The components of a system under analysis that generate data are the parameters of that system.
Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses different types of mathematical algorithms 
along with computer software code to analyse data, identify data types, categorize data, model a systems behaviour, make 
future predictions. The algorithm is trained and tested on the patitions of the available data from the observed system.
Machine Learning algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised.

Types of Machine Learning Algorithms that I have learned and implemented:

1. Regression Models

Regression modelling in machine learning consists of mathematical methods that allow data scientists 
     to predict a continuous outcome (y) based on the value of one or more predictor parameters (x).
     Linear regression is probably the most popular form of regression analysis.
     Clustering Models

2. Classification Models
    
Classification is a machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a 
given input data, and placing it in a group with other data elements. This is done having prior knowledge
of the type of data that is being analyzed, and the different themes and feateurs in the data set.

3. Clustering Algorithms

In machine learning, grouping unkown data from a dataset that is not labelled is called cluster analysis.
A clustering algorithm is used to comb through the data and find similiraities in the data. After many 
iterations, the data set gets organized into clusters that have common themes and features. The K-means
algorithm is a clustering algorithm that is used for this technique.
Model Selection 

4. Model Selection

In statistics, model selection is a process researchers use to compare the relative 
value of different statistical models and determine which one is the best fit for the 
observed data. In machine learning, model selection is the process of selecting one final machine learning model 
from among a collection of candidate machine learning models for a training dataset. Model selection 
is a process that can be applied different types of machine learning models.Some methods include Principal 
Component Analysis, Linear Deterministic Analysis, and Kernel PCA.

5. Dimensionality Reduction
 
 Dimensionality reduction (or dimension reduction), is the transformation of data 
from a high-dimensional space (many parameters) into a low-dimensional space (one or two parameters), 
while ensuring that that the low-dimensional space representation of the data set retains key properties 
of the high-dimensional data set.

6. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired 
behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. A reinforcement learning algorithm
is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial 
and error.One of these methods is Thmopson sampling.

Thompson sampling consists of choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a 
randomly drawn belief. It is a reinforcement learning algorithm that follows exploration and exploitation 
gradually refines a model of the probability of the reward for each action

7. XG Model Boosting
      *XGBoost improves model generalization capabilities. It delivers high performance as 
compared to other methods (i.e. gradient Boosting). Its training is very fast and can be parallelized across 
clusters using tree learning algorithms. It is also used to boodt machine learning abilities of linear,
and calssification model algorithms.
