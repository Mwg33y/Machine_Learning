# Machine_Learning

In Machine Learning, an algorithm uses the data from a system to give us insights and decision making abilities with 
respect to the system. The components of a system under analysis that generate data are the parameters of that system.
Machine Learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses different types of mathematical algorithms 
along with computer software code to analyse data, identify data types, categorize data, model a systems behaviour, make 
future predictions. The algorithm is trained and tested on the patitions of the available data from the observed system.
Machine Learning algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised.

Types of Machine Learning Algorithms that I have learned and implemented:

Regression Models

Clustering Models

Classification Models

Model Selection 

Dimensionality Reduction

Reinforcement Learning
